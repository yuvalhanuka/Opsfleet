Do not invent or infer beyond the supplied data.\n3) If parts of the question cannot be fully answered with the available data, answer only what is supported and explicitly state what information is missing to complete the response.\n4) If query execution result indicates an error during data fetching, clearly explain the error .\n\nOutput\n- A clear, concise final answer based solely on query_execution_result. If partial, include a short What is missing note describing the absent data needed for a full response."
